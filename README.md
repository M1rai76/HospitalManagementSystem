# JavaProject
This project aims to develop a user management system for a clinic or doctor's office, with functionalities beyond basic login and signup. Authorized users can manage patient and doctor details, including inputting, displaying, and now viewing a list of all doctors. Additionally, the system allows for booking appointments between patients and doctors.
Scope:
This project focuses on core functionalities with improvements:
•	User login and signup with username and password (plain text storage - for educational purposes only).
•	Patient and doctor information management:
o	Input details (ID, name, contact number, age).
o	Display details for a specific patient or doctor based on ID.
o	View a list of all doctors for patient browsing (new feature).
•	Appointment booking between existing patients and doctors (basic functionality without time slots or scheduling).
